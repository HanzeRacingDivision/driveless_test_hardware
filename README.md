# driveless_test_hardware
hardware (3d prints &amp; minimal circuits) designs and firmware for the various testing vehicles for the driverless software.
I (Thijs van Liempd) have so far worked on 2 testing platforms (cars):
  - the model RC car with servo->ADC-based steering sensor, a DIY-IR-rotary encoder for wheelspeed and only the 5$ LiDAR (no cameras (yet?))
  - the kart with wheelchair-motor + magnetic encoder steering, a TBD wheelspeed sensor and TBD sensors (probably LiDAR & camera(s))

both cars (before modifications) were provided by Cor Scholte and will need to be returned at some point (i think).
